              Our aim is to provide a very easy-to-use website that allows
              people to create their own ERC-20 token. By making it as simple as
              possible - without the requirement to log in, set up an email
              address or pay for using it - we hope crypto enthusiasts will use
              this project to create new tokens for their friends and therefore
              raise awareness and increase public interest in the technology.

              This is a proof of concept application to showcase the ease with
              which you can create a token using the ethereum blockchain. It is
              also nice to be able to tell that you can create your own
              &quot;cryptocurrency&quot; in less than a minute and less than
              three clicks.

            <h4>Metamask</h4>
            This applications uses <a href="https://metamask.io">Metamask</a> a
            web browser extension to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. You
            can install it on firefox and chrome as well as on mobile.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h4>Faucets, testnets and mainNet</h4>
            Although the application is entirely free you will need to pay a
            couple of cents in $ETH to deploy on the mainnet and have a real{' '}
            <a href="https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard">
              ERC20 token
            </a>
            . If you want to deploy entirely for free you can try the
            application on a testet like the{' '}
            <a href="https://rinkeby.io">Rinkeby network</a> and request some
            testnet ether on this{' '}

            <Card.Text>
              Maybe?
              <br />
              You could use that to digitalize assets or just for the bragging
              rights of telling you have your own coin.
              <br />
              Also it was nice to provide a free alternative to the following
              website <a href="https://tokenmint.io/">here</a> (40$ for a token,
              400$ for an ICO!). The service is entirely free and we collect no
              data (at all).

              We aim to add new functionnalities in the future, like different
              type of token contracts and maybe an ICO function. OnClickICO
              coming soon!
